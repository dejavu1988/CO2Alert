V1.1.3
2012-11-29  Xiang Gao  <xzgao@cs.helsinki.fi>
	* module transition: Setting <-> Map -> Summary -> Setting.
	* tune execution sequence in MapTracking.java: change the location of location listener in onResume() and onCreate();
		remove getLastKnownLocation section in init().
	* add calculation of duration: set StartTime and update CurrentTime & LastTime (timestamps) on location change;
		fix getTotal to support duration;
		add reading of duration in Toast and speech.
	


V1.1.2
2012-11-27  Xiang Gao  <xzgao@cs.helsinki.fi>
	* MapTracking.java: 
		fix bug in CO2 calculation logic: calculate based on sum distance, give wrong result in transfer;
		merge getCO2Emission() and getDistance() to getTotal(), which incrementally calculate distance and CO2 emission.
	* SummaryActivity.java in progress.
	* /menu/activity_maptracking.xml: add "Commit" item to option menu
		
V1.1.1
2012-11-26  Xiang Gao  <xzgao@cs.helsinki.fi>
	* MapTracking.java: 
		add support to active alert: add threstold constant and threshold block flag; 
			check condition for active alert on location change listened;
			speak with TTS the alert sentence once and block active alert condition;
		update Toast display: add Toast show on each location change without speech;
			set Toast duration to short length;
			chang Toast position to top of screen to avoid overlap of option menu;

V1.1
2012-11-26  Xiang Gao  <xzgao@cs.helsinki.fi>

    * activity_welcome.xml: add TextView for version info;
	
	* activity_setting.xml: add 3 more modes to radio group: walking, bicycle, train, and change tramcar to tram.
	
	* SettingActivity.java: set new variables bundled to added radiobutton; 
		change units in CO2 calculation (gram and meter) and changes M value based on resource from French Environmental Agency; 
		use finish() method instead of killing process for exit action.
	
	* /menu/activity_maptracking.xml: add option menu view to map view: 5 items (Transfer, Satellite view, Normal view, Clear, About) and 8 items in submenu of "Transfer".
	
	* MapTracking.java: add methods onCreateOptionsMenu and onOptionsItemSelected in onCreate() to handle option menu actions;
		add support to view satellite map and switch with normal map: set isSatellite() and give toast;
		add about option to give an AlertDialog about info of project, license, groupwork;
		add support to clear current overlays and reset accumulators without leaving MapView;
		add support to transfer between transportation modes enabling view of hybrid routes and statistics as a whole: control M coefficient and COLOR in transfer, which are sent as reference input parameter to getCO2Emission() and overlays.add();
		tune calculation process: add NEWSumDistance to round the value, change formula based on unit conversion, round to 1 digit after decimal point to make sense and facilitate speech;
		tune Toast and speaking triggered by shaking: update units used, trim visualized toast box;
		add a flag isGPSOn to solve the problem of jumping points caused by running both GPS and network listeners, give GPS listener higher priority and default block to network listener.
	
	* ShakeListener.java: correct the algorithm: change speed and position to acceleration and vector, use composite delta to test threshold, remove interval, update threshold.
	

V1.0
2012-11-24  Junlong Xiang  <lxsgdtc@gmail.com>

	* WelcomeActivity.java: show up welcome view of delayed time, switch to Setting Activity;
	  activity_welcome.xml: a TextView of groupwork members.
	  
    * SettingActivity.java: MyGroupListener listens selection of transportation mode from radiogroup, set M coefficient;
		MyButtonListener listens click on Startbutton, switching to MapTracking;
		StopButtonListener listens click on Exitbutton and finishes main activity;
	  activity_setting.xml: radiogroup of transportation modes, startbutton and exitbutton

    * MapTracking.java: mapControl, onResume, init and initMyLocation initiate location service;
		onLocationChange set operation triggered by locationlistener;
		LineOverlay handles drawing route on overlay of mapview;
		getDistance and getCO2Emission update accumulators; 
		TTS setup and speaking method; 
		ShakeListener implements onShake;
	  activity_maptracking.xml: MapView
	  
	* ShakeListener.java: initiate sensors with sensorManager, and register listener to sensor data change;
		onSensorChanged triggered operation including testing delta value with threshold.
